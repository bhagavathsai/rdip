Local Version Control Systems
Centralized Version Control Systems
Distributed Version Control Systems
Local Version Control Systems: It is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept
 all the changes to files under revision control.
 RCS is one of the most common VCS tools. 
It keeps patch sets (differences between files) in a special format on disk. 
By adding up all the patches it can then re-create what any file looked like at any 
point in time.
